# Silver Unicorn

Silver Unicorn is a collection of hacks and APIs that aims to serve as a prototyping platform for Augmented Reality by handling human-digital-physical interactions. The original project includes a hack for Microsoft Hololens that set up a complete loop of interactions between a human using voice to control a Sphero via a TCP server running on a Mac OS app. The Sphero was contained in a box with an image that was marked and recognized by the Vuforia engine running on Hololens, which then rendered a digital object for the user to interact with.
